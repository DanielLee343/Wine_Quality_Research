# Wine_Quality_Research

This project's goal is to determine under which proportion of eleven attributes are we able to get the best quality of red wine based on machine learning. The eleven attributes are:

·Fixed acidity

·Volatile acidity

·Citric acid

·Residual Sugar

·Chlorides

·Free sulfur dioxide

·Total sulfur dioxide 

·Density

·pH

·Sulphates

·Alcohol



The range of wine quality stretches from 4 (worst) to 7 (best).
